OpenRegion - bypass region lock on 3DS firmware v4.x
====================================================

Launch games from any region using the well known DS profile exploit in System Settings.

Installation:

1) Install ROP using a DS mode flash cart (choose Launcher.dat 4.x when using the ropMultiloader)

2) Copy the Launcher.dat file to the root of your SD card.

After putting the game cart in your 3DS goto:

System Setting -> Other Settings -> Profile -> Nintendo DS Profile

Then wait a few seconds for your game to launch.

Happy Gaming!
